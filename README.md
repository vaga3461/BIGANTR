# BIGANTR
Repository containing code for the model described in Gabel et al., 2024 (A mathematical model for bedrock incision in near-threshold gravel-bed rivers), plus information on model runs

The name "BIGANTR" comes from a previously used model acronym (Bedrock Incising Gravel Abrading Near Threshold River). We chose to abandon the use of this acronym throughout the manuscript, but the reader will encounter it in the naming of this code respository and files contained herein.
